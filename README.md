# Pure CSS gallery

This is a pure HTML/CSS gallery for my analog paintings. It uses CSS grid. The gallery is responsive and works on mobile devices.

If you hover over the gallery items, you can see the title of the painting. If you click on an item, you can see the painting in full size in a new tab.

For accessibility purposes, the gallery items are links with aria-labels. If you click on them, you will be redirected to the full size image. If you use a screen reader, you will hear the title of the painting.
